## Abstract:

As a practice project outside of working my full-time job, I used MongoDB, Express, React.js, and Node to create an app where users can create intentions, view intentions, update intentions, and delete intentions. 

The focus of this project was on the backend and as a result, sacrifices on styling and appearance were made as a trade off (which was tough to live with being someone who mainly works in the front end).

For future iterations I'd like to add a login and logout option, user authentication, and eventually fix up the styling. 

## Setup:

First, clone down the repo.

```bash
git clone 
```

Once you have cloned the repo, install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```
